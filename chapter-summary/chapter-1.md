# Chapter 1

## Centralized Version Control System

pros:

- help to collaborate with developers
- help to solve administrative questions
- developers know what everyone else on the project is doing

cons:

- single point of failure that centralized server represents
- not possible to work without connection to the server
- slow update/commit operations

## Distributed Version Control System

pros:

- each user receive full copy of repository (not only snapshot)
- possible to have more ways of collaboration between different groups of people

## Some of the goals of Git  were as follows

- Speed
- Simple design
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
- Fully distributed
- Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
